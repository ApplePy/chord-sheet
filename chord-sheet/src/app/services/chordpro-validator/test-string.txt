{t:Hallelujah}

#
#This tab is for Hallelujah, as i've found i've not really gotten on with the other ones
#here. The song is obviously picked but if you find that too difficult it also works
#well strummed but picking the root notes of the chord with your thumb. With the G and E7
#the start of each verse do a 2-3 up to the G and a 2-0 on the way down to the E7 on the
#E string.

[G]  [Em]  [G]  [Em]
[G]I heard there was a s[Em]ecret chord
That [G]David played and it [Em]pleased the Lord
But [C]you don't really [D7] care for music, d[G]o ya?   [D7]
W[G]ell it goes like this the [C]fourth, the [D7]fifth
[Em]The minor fall and the [C]major lift
The [D7]baffled king [B7]composing halle[Em]lujah
{soc}
Ha[C]llelujah, ha[Em]llelujah, ha[C]llelujah, ha[G]llelu[D7]-u-u-u-ja[G]aah     [Em]  [G]  [Em]
